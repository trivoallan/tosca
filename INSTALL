Welcome aboard

You need some devel packages before installing required gems.
  ruby-devel mysql-devel libMagick-devel oniguruma-devel mysql-ruby

The first three are commonly available on linux distribution. Oniguruma and 
 the C bindings to MySQL are commonly unavailable, so a tarball of sources is 
provided in tools/ directory.

After that, you need those gems :
  sudo gem install rails rmagick mysql gettext ruport ruport-util ultraviolet rubyzip -y
In order to be able to : 
* launch the rails app (rails)
* resize image (rmagick)
* connect to database (mysql)
* having multilingual support (gettext)
* generate ods report (ruport and ruport-util)
* having cool js preview (ultraviolet)

And you will need a small patch over action_controller gem 
(dependency of rails) :
  sudo cp app/views/rescues/_trace.rhtml /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/actionpack-1.*/lib/action_controller/templates/rescues/
OR, if you are on f***ing Debian : 
  sudo cp app/views/rescues/_trace.rhtml /var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/actionpack-1.*/lib/action_controller/templates/rescues/_trace.rhtml

If you encounter problems when editing fields, you'll need to patch the system's date.rb in (/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/date.rb for me), line 252:
<code>
  [MONTHNAMES, DAYNAMES, ABBR_MONTHNAMES, ABBR_DAYNAMES].each do |xs|
    xs.each{|x| x.freeze}.freeze
  end
</code>
