In Short
========

$ sudo urpmi ruby-devel mysql-devel libMagick-devel libonig-devel ruby-mysql
OR
$ sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev libwmf-bin libmagick9-dev ruby1.8-dev libonig-dev


$ sudo gem install rails
$ sudo rake gems:install
$ rake db:create:all
$ rake tosca:generate
$ rake l10n:mo
This one is optional :
$ sudo cp app/views/rescues/_trace.erb /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/actionpack-2.0.2/lib/action_controller/templates/rescues/_trace.erb


With Details
============
*** You need some devel packages before installing required gems.
  ruby-devel mysql-devel libMagick-devel oniguruma-devel mysql-ruby

The first three are commonly available on linux distribution. Oniguruma and
 the C bindings to MySQL are commonly unavailable, so a tarball of sources is
provided in tools/ directory.

*** After that, you need those gems :
  sudo gem install rails rmagick mysql gettext ruport ruport-util ultraviolet rubyzip -y
In order to be able to :
* launch the rails app (rails)
* resize image (rmagick)
* connect to database (mysql)
* having multilingual support (gettext)
* generate ods report (ruport and ruport-util)
* having cool js preview (ultraviolet)

*** And you will need a small patch over action_controller gem
(dependency of rails) :
  sudo cp app/views/rescues/_trace.erb /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/actionpack-2.0.2/lib/action_controller/templates/rescues/_trace.erb
OR, if you are on Debian:
  sudo cp app/views/rescues/_trace.erb /var/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/actionpack-2.0.2/lib/action_controller/templates/rescues/_trace.erb

If you encounter problems when editing fields, you'll need to patch the system's date.rb in (/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/date.rb for me), line 252:
<code>
  [MONTHNAMES, DAYNAMES, ABBR_MONTHNAMES, ABBR_DAYNAMES].each do |xs|
    xs.each{|x| x.freeze}.freeze
  end
</code>

After installing all of this, you will need to dump the test database,
and the default translation :
$ rake db:schema:load
$ rake db:fixtures:load
$ rake makemo
