  summary: A version control system.

  description: <p>CVS (Concurrent Version System) is a version control system that can<br />record the history of your files (usually, but not always, source<br />code). CVS only stores the differences between versions, instead of<br />every version of every file you have ever created. CVS also keeps a log<br />of who, when, and why changes occurred.<br /><br />CVS is very helpful for managing releases and controlling the<br />concurrent editing of source files among multiple authors. Instead of<br />providing version control for a collection of files in a single<br />directory, CVS provides version control for a hierarchical collection<br />of directories consisting of revision controlled files. These<br />directories and files can then be combined together to form a software<br />release.</p>
